 ## About me

 father to my son, Hunter, and with my beautiful wife and fantastic mother, Kaylin, living in the UK, avid hobbyist!

 enjoying all aspects of life, photography, archery, motorcycling, aquariums, astronomy, and ofcourse, computers!

 I have been coding AHK and been an active member of the AHK irc community for over 10 years.

 my main passion being speed, ease of use, efficiency, batch and parallel processing within ahk.

 ## Donations

 i just do this for fun, mainly because i hate charging people money for my work as we all have different financial means, so i always prefer to "charge" people however much it is worth to them, maybe it's $10, maybe it's $0! it doesn't matter! so long as this software isn't put out of your reach simply due to money, like other more greedy developers!
 for this reason, none of my assistance or software costs money, and it never will! it's all free, with no adverts other than a single convenient, unobtrusive "support me" link.

 Any money we receive will go straight towards bettering my sons life in any way we can!
